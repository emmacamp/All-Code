        <p>
            JavaScript (commonly abbreviated JS ) is an interpreted programming language , dialect of the ECMAScript standard . It is defined as object-oriented , 2 â€‹prototype -based , imperative, weakly-typed , and dynamic .
            <br><br>
            It is primarily used client-side , implemented as part of a web browser allowing user interface enhancements and dynamic web pages 3 and server -side JavaScript ( Server-side JavaScript or SSJS ). Its use in applications outside the web , for example in PDF documents , desktop applications (mostly widgets ) is also significant.
            <br><br>
            JavaScript was designed with syntax similar to C , [ citation needed ] although it adopts names and conventions from the Java programming language . However, Java and JavaScript have different semantics and purposes. Their relationship is purely commercial, after the purchase of the creator of Java (Sun Microsystems) from Nestcape Navigator (creator of LiveScript) and the change of name of the programming language.
            <br><br>
            All modern browsers interpret JavaScript code embedded in web pages. To interact with a web page, the JavaScript language is provided with an implementation of the Document Object Model (DOM). Javascript is the only programming language that browsers understand natively.

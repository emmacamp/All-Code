        <h1>Python</h1>
        <p>
            Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
            <br><br>
            Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library. It interprets and executes programs in a dynamic language, and its high-level built-in data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, and sets, make it very efficient for large data processing. Python is also suitable for software development, as it is an interpreted language, which means that the program is interpreted by the Python interpreter rather than compiled to machine code. <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more info</a>
